# Swift Bitcoin PoC

Proof of concept for exploring the potential of a pure-Swift Bitcoin library.

Successfully implements a transaction verification model with full segwit and taproot/tapscript support.

Development has subsequently moved to https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin for a more careful, production-ready SDK.
